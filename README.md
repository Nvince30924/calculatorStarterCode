This is an app of a simple calculator that does basic operations such as **addition**,**subtraction** , 
**multiplication** and **division**. 
It also generates a **random number** 
as well as **squaring a number** and **logBase10**.
Java script was incorporated in HTML in order 
to make this projects. Html was used to display buttons using 
div(s) and that java script was used to create functions and their results(return).
As a result we was able to make a simple calculator. If more time was given then 
I would have fixed the display of buttons and changed its colors.
